## Visual Studio on Windows

Install [Visual Studio Express 2013 for web](http://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-express-vs.aspx). This will include the IDE and web development tools.

To get started, you can download a Visual Studio solution that is already set up to work with JavaScript and the other languages that Visual Studio supports.

If you have a paid version of Visual Studio, you should install the [Web Essentials](http://vswebessentials.com/) extension. It will make working with Javascript much easier.

You can run the unit tests from a node.js command line using the batch file in the project.

```
C:\Src\exercises\javascript>test example\bob-test.spec.js
.................

Finished in 0.02 seconds
17 tests, 17 assertions, 0 failures, 0 skipped
```

If you do not see any output from running the tests, you are likely not in a Node.js command prompt.
