# Grains

Calculate the number of grains of wheat on a chessboard given that the number
on each square doubles.

There once was a wise servant who saved the life of a prince. The king
promised to pay whatever the servant could dream up. Knowing that the
king loved chess, the servant told the king he would like to have grains
of wheat. One grain on the first square of a chess board. Two grains on
the next. Four on the third, and so on.

There are 64 squares on a chessboard.

Write code that shows:
- how many grains were on each square, and
- the total number of grains

## For bonus points

Did you get the tests passing and the code clean? If you want to, these
are some additional things you could try:

- Optimize for speed.
- Optimize for readability.

## Running the test suite

The provided test suite uses [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/).
You can install it by opening a terminal window and running the
following command:

```sh
npm install -g jasmine
```

Run the test suite from the exercise directory with:

```sh
jasmine grains.spec.js
```

In many test suites all but the first test have been marked "pending".
Once you get a test passing, activate the next one by changing `xit` to `it`.
