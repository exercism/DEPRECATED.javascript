# Grains

Calculate the number of grains of wheat on a chessboard given that the number
on each square doubles.

There once was a wise servant who saved the life of a prince. The king
promised to pay whatever the servant could dream up. Knowing that the
king loved chess, the servant told the king he would like to have grains
of wheat. One grain on the first square of a chess board. Two grains on
the next. Four on the third, and so on.

There are 64 squares on a chessboard.

Write code that shows:
- how many grains were on each square, and
- the total number of grains

## Setup

Go through the setup instructions for JavaScript to
install the necessary dependencies:

## Making the Test Suite Pass

Execute the tests with:

    jasmine <exercise-name>.spec.js

Replace `<exercise-name>` with the name of the current exercise. E.g., to
test the Hello World exercise:

    jasmine hello-world.spec.js

In many test suites all but the first test have been skipped.

Once you get a test passing, you can unskip the next one by
changing `xit` to `it`.
