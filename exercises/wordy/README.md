# Wordy

Parse and evaluate simple math word problems returning the answer as an integer.

## Iteration 1 — Addition

Add two numbers together.

> What is 5 plus 13?

Evaluates to 18.

Handle large numbers and negative numbers.

## Iteration 2 — Subtraction, Multiplication and Division

Now, perform the other three operations.

> What is 7 minus 5?

2

> What is 6 multiplied by 4?

24

> What is 25 divided by 5?

5

## Iteration 3 — Multiple Operations

Handle a set of operations, in sequence.

Since these are verbal word problems, evaluate the expression from
left-to-right, _ignoring the typical order of operations._

> What is 5 plus 13 plus 6?

24

> What is 3 plus 2 multiplied by 3?

15  (i.e. not 9)

## Bonus — Exponentials

If you'd like, handle exponentials.

> What is 2 raised to the 5th power?

32

## Running the test suite

The provided test suite uses [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/).
You can install it by opening a terminal window and running the
following command:

```sh
npm install -g jasmine
```

Run the test suite from the exercise directory with:

```sh
jasmine wordy.spec.js
```

In many test suites all but the first test have been marked "pending".
Once you get a test passing, activate the next one by changing `xit` to `it`.
