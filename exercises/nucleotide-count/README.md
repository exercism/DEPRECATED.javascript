# Nucleotide Count

Given a DNA string, compute how many times each nucleotide occurs in the string.

DNA is represented by an alphabet of the following symbols: 'A', 'C',
'G', and 'T'.

Each symbol represents a nucleotide, which is a fancy name for the
particular molecules that happen to make up a large part of DNA.

Shortest intro to biochemistry EVAR:

- twigs are to birds nests as
- nucleotides are to DNA and RNA as
- amino acids are to proteins as
- sugar is to starch as
- oh crap lipids

I'm not going to talk about lipids because they're crazy complex.

So back to nucleotides.

DNA contains four types of them: adenine (`A`), cytosine (`C`), guanine
(`G`), and thymine (`T`).

RNA contains a slightly different set of nucleotides, but we don't care
about that for now.

## Setup

Go through the setup instructions for JavaScript to
install the necessary dependencies:

## Making the Test Suite Pass

Execute the tests with:

    jasmine <exercise-name>.spec.js

Replace `<exercise-name>` with the name of the current exercise. E.g., to
test the Hello World exercise:

    jasmine hello-world.spec.js

In many test suites all but the first test have been skipped.

Once you get a test passing, you can unskip the next one by
changing `xit` to `it`.

## Submitting Incomplete Solutions
It's possible to submit an incomplete solution so you can see how others have completed the exercise.
