# Diamond

The diamond kata takes as its input a letter, and outputs it in a diamond 
shape. Given a letter, it prints a diamond starting with 'A', with the 
supplied letter at the widest point.

## Requirements

* The first row contains one 'A'.
* The last row contains one 'A'.
* All rows, except the first and last, have exactly two identical letters.
* All rows have as many trailing spaces as leading spaces. (This might be 0).
* The diamond is horizontally symmetric.
* The diamond is vertically symmetric.
* The diamond has a square shape (width equals height).
* The letters form a diamond shape.
* The top half has the letters in ascending order.
* The bottom half has the letters in descending order. 
* The four corners (containing the spaces) are triangles.

## Examples

In the following examples, spaces are indicated by `·` characters.

Diamond for letter 'A':

```plain
A
```

Diamond for letter 'C':

```plain
··A··
·B·B·
C···C
·B·B·
··A··
```

Diamond for letter 'E':

```plain
····A····
···B·B···
··C···C··
·D·····D·
E·······E
·D·····D·
··C···C··
···B·B···
····A····
```

## Setup

Go through the setup instructions for JavaScript to
install the necessary dependencies:

## Making the Test Suite Pass

Execute the tests with:

    jasmine <exercise-name>.spec.js

Replace `<exercise-name>` with the name of the current exercise. E.g., to
test the Hello World exercise:

    jasmine hello-world.spec.js

In many test suites all but the first test have been skipped.

Once you get a test passing, you can unskip the next one by
changing `xit` to `it`.
