# Acronym

Convert a phrase to its acronym.

Techies love their TLA (Three Letter Acronyms)!

Help generate some jargon by writing a program that converts a long name
like Portable Network Graphics to its acronym (PNG).

## Setup

Go through the setup instructions for JavaScript to install the
 necessary dependencies:

## Running the test suite

The provided test suite uses [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/).
You can install it by opening a terminal window and running the
following command:

```sh
npm install -g jasmine
```

Run the test suite from the exercise directory with:

```sh
jasmine acronym.spec.js
```

In many test suites all but the first test have been marked "pending".
Once you get a test passing, activate the next one by changing `xit` to `it`.
