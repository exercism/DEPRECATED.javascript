# Sum Of Multiples

Given a number, find the sum of all the multiples of particular numbers up to
but not including that number.

If we list all the natural numbers up to but not including 20 that are
multiples of either 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9, 10, 12, 15, and 18.

The sum of these multiples is 78.

Given a number, find the sum of the multiples of a given set of numbers,
up to but not including that number.

## Setup

Go through the setup instructions for JavaScript to
install the necessary dependencies:

## Making the Test Suite Pass

Execute the tests with:

    jasmine <exercise-name>.spec.js

Replace `<exercise-name>` with the name of the current exercise. E.g., to
test the Hello World exercise:

    jasmine hello-world.spec.js

In many test suites all but the first test have been skipped.

Once you get a test passing, you can unskip the next one by
changing `xit` to `it`.
