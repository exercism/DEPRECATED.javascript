# Flatten Array

Take a nested list and return a single flattened list with all values except nil/null.

The challenge is to write a function that accepts an arbitrarily-deep nested list-like structure and returns a flattened structure without any nil/null values.
 
For Example

input: [1,[2,3,null,4],[null],5]

output: [1,2,3,4,5]


## Setup

Go through the setup instructions for JavaScript to
install the necessary dependencies:

http://exercism.io/languages/javascript

## Making the Test Suite Pass

Execute the tests with:

    jasmine <exercise-name>.spec.js

Replace `<exercise-name>` with the name of the current exercise. E.g., to
test the Hello World exercise:

    jasmine hello-world.spec.js

In many test suites all but the first test have been skipped.

Once you get a test passing, you can unskip the next one by
changing `xit` to `it`.
